# CV End Term Exam Program - BTech CSE

## Overview

This repository contains the program developed for the **Computer Vision (CV) End Term Exam** for the undergraduate **BTech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)**. The project is a part of the final evaluation for the **Computer Vision** course and showcases the application of various image processing and machine learning techniques covered throughout the semester.

## Contents

* **Main Program**: The core functionality of the program, implemented in Python (or any other programming language used).
* **Models**: Pre-trained models or custom-built models used for image recognition, object detection, or other tasks related to the exam.
* **Datasets**: Sample datasets used to test and validate the program.
* **Requirements**: List of dependencies and libraries used in the project.
* **Documentation**: Instructions on how to set up and use the program, including an explanation of the methodology.

## Features

* Image Preprocessing: Techniques for enhancing and preparing images for analysis.
* Object Detection/Recognition: Model trained to detect and recognize objects in images.
* Performance Metrics: Evaluation of the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
* User Interface: (Optional) A simple UI for interacting with the program (if implemented).

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:
